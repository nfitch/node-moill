Things to do, in no particular order:

### Packaging ###
- Make npm test actually run all the tests.
- Make tests quit on first error.

### Moill Server ###
- Use a logger rather than the console.  
- Add more logging.
- Use a db rather than an in-memory ILL structure.
- Make moill-actions throw errors internally rather than checking bools everywhere.
- Change all validations in test-moill-server.js to compare objects rather than strings.

### Moill UI ###
- Error handling when .get fails.
- Hover to help rather than having the instructions on the front page.
- Implement Multiple Lists
- Drag and drop within a list.
- Drag and drop between lists.
